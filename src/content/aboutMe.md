I’m <span>Lakshman</span> , a self-taught <span>Full Stack</span> developer , from <span>Bangladesh</span> .

I am able to build a website with a full database back end, amazing and light layout, from scratch. Great _team player_ and _responsible person_. I studied _software engineering_ at Daffodil International University and have always had a passion for _technology_. In love with Front-End development and proficient in _Back-End_ development. I also have extensive experience working with groups on multiple projects.

Always striving to apply my programming skills to make applications _perform smoothly_ and more open to the _world_. I want to find solutions to the technically challenging facets of applications. I'm _excited_ to employ the skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team in order to build better experiences on the web.

I always want to _learn more_, _do more_, and _be more_. I’m also a firm believer that we should <span>never settle</span>.

I’m _hard working_, _super curious_, _passionate_, _committed_, and also a _fast learner_!
