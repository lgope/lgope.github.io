I am <span>Lakshman</span> , a passionate <span>Software Engineer</span> , from <span>Bangladesh</span> .

A _Software Engineer_. Who enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide _pixel-perfect_, _smooth performant experiences_.

Always striving to apply my programming skills to make applications _perform smoothly_ and more open to the _world_. I want to find solutions to the technically challenging facets of applications. I'm _excited_ to employ the skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team in order to build better experiences on the web.

I always want to _learn more_, _do more_, and _be more_. I’m also a firm believer that we should <span>never settle</span>.

I’m _hard working_, _super curious_, _passionate_, _committed_, and also a _fast learner_!
